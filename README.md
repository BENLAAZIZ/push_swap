# push_swap


`Push_swap` is a project designed to provide hands-on experience with sorting algorithms and optimization techniques. The task involves arranging a stack of integers named "stack a" using a restricted set of operations (push, swap, and rotate) while aiming to minimize the number of movements required. Initially, all numbers are placed consecutively in stack a, and the objective is to eventually have them sorted within this stack using the provided operations.
